</div>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; monitoring of the tuberculosis epidemic situation in the Siberian and Far Eastern Federal Districts using classical and molecular epidemiological research methods;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; identification of epidemiological risk factors for the spread of primary resistant tuberculosis in specific territories;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; comprehensive assessment of significant factors affecting the tuberculosis situation in the Institute's curation area.<br>
 <br>
 Development of new anti-tuberculosis management mechanisms in Siberia and the Far East:<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; analysis of the situation, planning and organization of anti-tuberculosis measures at various levels of subordination - research institutes, health management bodies in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, head territorial anti-tuberculosis institutions;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; creation of a management model for tuberculosis control processes.<br>
 <br>
 Improvement of diagnostic and treatment methods:<br>
 <br>
