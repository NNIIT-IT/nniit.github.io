The establishment of the Siberian School of Phthisiologists coincided with the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, when in December 1941 the Central Institute of Tuberculosis was evacuated from Moscow to Novosibirsk. It was located in building No. 75 on Rabochaya Street (now Chaplygina Street)<br>
 By order of the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR dated October 4, 1943, No. 19533-r, the Novosibirsk Regional Research Institute of Tuberculosis was organized.<br>

 Quickly, on the 3rd day (!), Order No. 515 of the People's Commissariat of Health of the USSR was issued on the practical side of the formation of the future federal research institute:<br>

 Alexandra Apollonovna Letunova became the first director of the Institute. Subsequently, the heads of the NNIIT were: Anna Georgievna Minina, Richard Karlovich Losinger, Mikhail Vasilyevich Svirezhev, Boris Nikolaevich Priss, Igor Grigorievich Ursov, Alexey Sevastyanovich Tarasov. From 1989 to 2019, the Institute was headed by Honored Doctor of Russia, MD, Professor Vladimir Alexandrovich Krasnov. In December 2019, she was appointed acting director, and on November 3, 2020, Natalia Vasilyevna Stavitskaya, MD, was confirmed as director, who is currently working.<br>
 <br>
 During the years of the institute's formation, its scientific activities were carried out in the following areas: organization of prevention and treatment of tuberculosis in children; testing of sulfonamide preparations for tuberculosis; diagnosis of the activity of the tuberculosis process; differential diagnosis of non-tuberculosis diseases using subcutaneous administration of tuberculin.<br>
 <br>
 Novosibirsk owes the introduction of phthisiosurgery into the comprehensive treatment of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis to Professor N.G. Stoyko, who in 1942 organized a 30-bed surgical department on the basis of a branch of the Central Tuberculosis Institute. Since then, the surgical service of NNIIT has been a school of phthisiosurgery in Western Siberia.<br>
 <br>
 It was here in different years:<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; original methods of destruction of pleural adhesions in case of defective therapeutic pneumothorax<br>
 have been developed. pneumothorax has been improved as a highly effective method of collapse therapy in case of destructive pulmonary tuberculosis against the background of chemotherapy<br>
 , fundamental innovations have been introduced into the technique of operations of extrapleural pneumolysis, lung decortication and pleurectomy<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A method of extrapleural atypical lung resection with limited thoracoplasty has been developed, a combined collapsosurgical method of cavern treatment - extrapleural pneumolysis with open tamponade and selective thoracoplasty<br>
 , a new method of open cavern treatment has been proposed.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A coherent system of combined and step-by-step surgical treatment of the most severe patients with common chronic and hyperchronic fibrous-cavernous pulmonary tuberculosis, previously considered inoperable, has been created.<br>
 <br>
 Traditionally, the Institute has paid special attention to the problems of extrapulmonary forms of tuberculosis. NNIIT has developed, studied, and proposed for clinical practice reconstructive and restorative methods of surgical treatment of osteoarticular tuberculosis; X-ray imaging capabilities for certain forms of abdominal tuberculosis; and the diagnostic significance of kidney biopsy in tuberculosis.<br>
 <br>
 Since 1970, under the leadership of I.G. Ursov, the staff of the Novosibirsk Research Institute of Tuberculosis and the departments of the Novosibirsk Medical Institute have successfully developed a fundamentally new direction of complex therapy for tuberculosis patients - intermittent bactericidal intravenous chemotherapy. In-depth research in this area has led to the justification of the most effective (closure of decay cavities - up to 86%) and cost-effective method of chemotherapy for tuberculosis patients.<br>
 <br>
 A great contribution to the development of phthisiology was made by the laboratory units and the experimental department of the Novosibirsk Research Institute. Here for the first time:<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issues of morphology and histochemistry of chronically ongoing primary tuberculosis were studied<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The biochemical characteristics of protein metabolism, oxidative processes, and acid-base balance in patients with fibrous-cavernous pulmonary tuberculosis who underwent open cavern treatment are given.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the possibilities of thermistography in the tuberculosis clinic are investigated<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quantitative criteria for assessing the physical performance of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis have been obtained<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The possibilities of immunotherapy of experimental tumors using the BCG vaccine are substantiated.<br>
 <br>
 It was at the Novosibirsk Tuberculosis Research Institute that a scientifically based program for inpatient and outpatient treatment of tuberculosis patients was developed. Its implementation in practical phthisiology has made it possible to reduce the inpatient stage of treatment, while maintaining the effectiveness of therapy, treating twice as many patients using the same financial resources.<br>
 <br>
 In recent decades, fundamental scientific research by NNIIT scientists has been conducted both in the field of tuberculosis epidemiology, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, and the creation of highly effective etiopathogenetic approaches to the treatment of tuberculosis using lysosomotropic dosage forms and methods of their targeted delivery to the lesion. NNIIT specialists:<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ways of solving the problem of targeted tuberculosis therapy are proposed<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of methods have been developed, the use of which makes it possible to increase the effectiveness of the treatment of genitourinary tuberculosis.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tactics of treatment of patients with destructive pulmonary tuberculosis with nonspecific purulent endobronchitis have been developed.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first time, a highly sensitive method for the diagnosis of tuberculosis infection has been developed using phagocyte migration to the "skin window" area when provoked by tuberculin.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A molecular epidemiological analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains circulating in the West Siberian region has been performed.<br>
 <br>
 Currently, the Novosibirsk Tuberculosis Research Institute is a scientific, organizational, methodological, and treatment and consulting center for tuberculosis activities. Since 2002, the Siberian Federal District has launched the implementation of a Tuberculosis Control System, which was developed at the NNIIT. On the initiative of the institute, a Specialized Tuberculosis Medical Council was established and operates in the Siberian Federal District, whose main task is to coordinate tuberculosis medical activities in the district.<br>
 <br>
 In 2003, the Novosibirsk Tuberculosis Research Institute presented a theoretically sound model of the Federal Tuberculosis Control Center in the Siberian Federal District. His task is the rational and competent use of management and supervision levers to organize the effective work of the phthisiological service and reduce the incidence of tuberculosis.<br>
 <br>
 The partners of NNIIT in solving the socially significant problem of tuberculosis are academic institutes of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, NGO Vector, Novosibirsk State Medical University.<br>
 <br>
 The history of the Institute is inextricably linked with the names of scientists and doctors who have made a significant contribution to the development of not only the Tuberculosis Research Institute itself, but also the entire Siberian phthisiology and phthisiosurgery. These are A.I. Borovinsky, V.E. Belyavsky, I.G. Ursov, G.M. Gorbunov, A.A. Andrenko, Yu.N. Kurunov, V.G.Kononenko, V.A.Potasheva, G.S.Murashkina, L.M.Pogozheva and many others.<br>
